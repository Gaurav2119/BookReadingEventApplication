# Book-Reading-Event-Application
Created an application to manage book-reading events using ASP.Net MVC. It will allow managing events across world wide. A book reading event is where book lovers come together for a community reading of their favourite book. One or more readers read the book loudly and optionally people even play different roles from the book!
